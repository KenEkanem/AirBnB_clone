## Project Description
This project is the beginning of the AirBnB Clone
This is the first part of the project focused on build a backend service using the cmd module
... 

## Command Interpreter
The command line interface of the application resembles the Bash shell, but it only accepts a specific set of commands that were created for use within the AirBnB website. This interpreter functions as the user interface of the web application, allowing users to interact with the backend that was built using object-oriented programming in Python.


## Installation
- Make sure you have python3 installed on your pc
